# Tower Defense

In this game, player must place monsters to attack enemies who are trying to eat the cookie.

## Features
  - Player can click the open spots to place a monster
  - Monsters can be upgraded twice that fire stronger bullets
  - Money gets deducted when a new monster is placed or upgraded
  - Money is earned when a monster defeats an enemy
  - Enemies move to a series of nodes in order and rotate to face the direction of the next node they are about to move to
  - There are four waves of enemies that incrementally get more difficult
    - First wave spawns 5 enemy 1
    - Second wave spawns 9 enemy 1 and 1 enemy 2
    - Third wave spawns 12 enemy 1 and 3 enemy 2
    - Forth wave spawns 5 enemy 2
  - Enemy 2 spawns after enemy 1 for more conventional gameplay
  - Enemy 2 moves slightly faster

## Issues
  - Enemy 2 is slightly faster than enemy 1 so they gradually overlap enemy 1
